Sharon has always been extremely helpful and efficient at finding great options and deals, both corporate and personal. We refer to Sharon as the ³Hotel Queen,² because she has been able to work her magic many times to accommodate our requirements. She never fails to deliver and certainly makes our lives easier by always going that extra mile. We would be lost without her."

                            <br><br>
                            My wife and I would like to personally “Thank you” for all the hard work you have provided us for our trips. You and your Company have been able to take care of whatever our needs have been all over the world, and have been able to anticipate our requests, and have suggested great ideas for each of our trips. While we are away we are comforted with the knowledge that you are following along with our daily itinerary, and verifying that all our reservations are intact. Should changes or cancellations occur, we appreciate that you will give us a heads up, and the corrected action you proactively have taken. Thank you again for all the great trips and memories you have helped to create! <br>
                            Sincerely, <br> <br>
                            --S & M Dickson

                           "I have been doing business with the Travel Connection and Sharon McManus for several years. In 2013 she booked a trip for me and three others to London. We then left London and took a two week cruise to Ireland on the Oceania cruise lines. The trip was fabulous and Sharon did an excellent job with all the accommodations. This last October Sharon booked a cruise to Alaska for 10 members of my family. It is a celebration for my 70th Birthday and we're all going from LA to Vancouver, to Alaska in August of this year.. Sharon has done a tremendous job with all the bookings and accommodations. This takes a great deal of work to figure all the details transporting 10 people, arranging tours, etc. Sharon has a great sense of humor and dealing with me she certainly needs it! I will always do my booking with Sharon and the Travel Connection."

                    <div class="col-lg-12">
                     
                        <p>
                          1. <strong>System Limitations:</strong> Complicated itineraries involving many destinations, airlines and stopovers are not booked efficiently on the web. Travel agents use sophisticated systems/GDS capable of handling any itinerary with unlimited destinations, stopovers and airlines.
                        </p>

                        </div>

                    <br>

                    <div class="row card points">
                    <div class="col-lg-12">
                     
                        <p>
                          2. <strong>Business class / First class international travel:</strong> We have access to negotiated fares which can save up to $500 on each ticket. Not just the ticket cost, conditions of the ticket are also often complicated requiring verbal and / or written explanation or else clients may not understand fully and may end up paying huge penalties.
                        </p>

                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="row card points">
                    <div class="col-lg-12">
                     
                        <p>
                          3. <strong>Waitlisting:</strong> We have the ability to waitlist a flight in a lower class and get it confirmed using our influence with airlines. This can save hundreds of dollars for economy fares and much more on business and first class. Especially for change of reservation, waitlisting can enable us to bring clients home earlier and cheaper. Online travel sites don't generally offer this much needed facility.
                        </p>

                        </div>

                    <br>
                    <div class="row card points">
                    <div class="col-lg-12">
                     
                        <p>
                          4. <strong>Seat searching:</strong> Travel agents can search and find a lower cost space to save money and enable early departures with better connections. Travel websites can not provide this facility due to lack of personal service and instant purchase requirements. We can hold space for 24 to 72 hours or more and during this period, can look for lower cost space and pass on savings.
                        </p>

                        </div>

                    <div class="col-lg-12">
                     
                        <p>
                          5. <strong>72 Hour hold:</strong> Most websites require instant purchase which is not okay for better decision since many plans change in 72 hour or less. Passengers booking online end up paying hefty change or cancellation penalties whereas those booking with us pay no fee generally since space was on hold and cancelled or changed before tickets are issued
                        </p>

                        </div>

                    <div class="col-lg-12">
                     
                        <p>
                          6. <strong>Economy net fares:</strong> Most airline sites and travel websites only show "Published" fares, not the "Negotiated" or net fares. These are not easy to show or book on websites but we have them due to wholesale contracts. For travellers to the Middle East, Africa, Asia and South Pacific; these unpublished fares are not only cheaper but often more flexible.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          7. <strong>Personal service and peace of mind:</strong> Travel agents like us provide on demand service and ensure peace of mind. Being local, you know us and we know you and such closeness cuts lots of time and procedures required on websites at the time of original booking, date and destination changes, refunds, schedule changes and flight cancellations.
                        </p>

                        </div>

                    <div class="col-lg-12">
                     
                        <p>
                         8. <strong>Matching web fares:</strong> Most full service travel agents like us can match online or valid website fares for Ocean and River Cruises, Business and First class international fares, most long haul international coach fares, prices for vacation packages, medium to high -end hotel rates and Travel Insurance. Since vendors pay us, we don't generally charge service fees on these bookings.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                         9. <strong>Payment options and amenities: </strong> Travel agents like us accept cash, check, credit card and may offer credit for few days to established clients. Few websites can offer such wide range of payment options or offer amenities provided by consortium affiliated travel agents like us.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                         10. <strong>Domestic Travel for businesses, busy individuals, seniors and groups:</strong> For a small service fee, we can do these bookings according to organization's policies, search lowest fares, offer extended deadlines to pay, make frequent date and destination changes and reissues, combine different airlines, offer better connections and handle group booking complications.
                        </p>
